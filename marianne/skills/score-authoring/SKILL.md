# Marianne Score Authoring Skill

> **Purpose**: Write correct, effective Marianne score configs. Routes to the appropriate reference docs based on score complexity.

---

## Triggers

| Use This Skill | Skip This Skill |
|---|---|
| Writing new Marianne score YAML | Debugging existing Marianne errors (use `/marianne:command`) |
| Reviewing/fixing score configs | Running/monitoring jobs |
| Understanding available features | CLI operations only |
| Designing multi-stage workflows | |

---

## Quick Syntax Reference

**The #1 rule**: Jinja `{{ }}` in the **prompt pipeline** (templates, prelude/cadenza paths, capture_files). Python format `{}` in the **validation engine** (validation paths, commands, working_directory, skip_when_command).

| Field | Syntax |
|---|---|
| `prompt.template` | `{{ workspace }}` |
| `validations[].path` | `{workspace}` |
| `validations[].command` | `{workspace}` |
| `capture_files[]` | `{{ workspace }}` |

### Injection: file vs. directory cadenzas

`prelude` and `cadenzas` items take exactly one of `file:` or `directory:`.

```yaml
sheet:
  cadenzas:
    1:
      - file: "{{ workspace }}/setup.md"        # one file
        as: skill
    2:
      - directory: "/abs/path/to/inputs"        # whole directory at once
        as: context
```

**Directory cadenzas are NOT recursive** — only the immediate children of the directory are injected. Subdirectories are silently ignored. If you need a deeper tree, flatten the input dir or list each subdir as its own cadenza item. A common pattern: a small `instrument: cli` preflight stage curates/copies the relevant files into one flat directory the cadenza points at.

See `patterns.md` → "Prelude & Cadenza" for full file/directory injection rules.

## Reference Docs

Load the docs matching your score's complexity tier:

| Tier | What to Load | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| **1** (simple pipeline) | `essentials.md` | Syntax, core variables, validations, config, YAML gotchas, pitfalls, pre-flight checklist |
| **2** (fan-out + synthesis) | `essentials.md` + `patterns.md` | + Design philosophy, fan-out patterns, Jinja mastery, prompt engineering, cross-sheet/parallel config |
| **3-5** (concert, self-chain, complex) | `essentials.md` + `patterns.md` + `advanced.md` | + Retry/rate limiting, circuit breaker, concert mode, post-success hooks, isolation, stale detection |

### Loading Instructions

Read the reference docs from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/ref/`:

```
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/ref/essentials.md   — always load
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/ref/patterns.md     — load for tier 2+
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/ref/advanced.md     — load for tier 3+
```

**When this skill is invoked directly** (e.g., `/marianne:score-authoring`), load all three docs — the caller may need any level of detail.
