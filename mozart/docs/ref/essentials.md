## THE CRITICAL DISTINCTION: Two Syntax Systems

Mozart uses **two different** template systems in the same YAML file. Confusing them is the #1 source of broken configs.

### Jinja2 (`{{ }}`) --- Prompt pipeline

```yaml
prompt:
  template: |
    Process sheet {{ sheet_num }} of {{ total_sheets }}.
    Write to {{ workspace }}/output-{{ sheet_num }}.md
```

- Jinja2 engine at render time
- Supports conditionals, loops, filters, macros, arithmetic
- Uses `{{ variable }}`, `{% if %}`, `{% for %}`
- `StrictUndefined` --- typos cause errors (good)

### Python format strings (`{}`) --- Validations and commands

```yaml
validations:
  - type: file_exists
    path: "{workspace}/output-{sheet_num}.md"
  - type: command_succeeds
    command: 'test -f "{workspace}/report.md"'
```

- Python `str.format()` (paths) or manual `str.replace()` (commands)
- Single braces only: `{workspace}`, `{sheet_num}`
- NO conditionals, loops, or expressions

### What goes wrong

```yaml
# WRONG --- Jinja syntax in validation path
validations:
  - type: file_exists
    path: "{{ workspace }}/output.md"
    # .format() treats {{ as literal {, producing "{ workspace }/output.md"

# CORRECT
validations:
  - type: file_exists
    path: "{workspace}/output.md"
```

```yaml
# WRONG --- format syntax in prompt template
prompt:
  template: |
    Write to {workspace}/output.md
    # Jinja ignores single braces --- rendered literally

# CORRECT
prompt:
  template: |
    Write to {{ workspace }}/output.md
```

**Rule**: Jinja `{{ }}` in the **prompt pipeline** (templates, prelude/cadenza paths, capture_files). Format `{}` in the **validation engine** (validation paths, commands, working_directory, skip_when_command).

| Field | Syntax | Engine |
|---|---|---|
| `prompt.template` / `prompt.template_file` | `{{ workspace }}` | Jinja2 |
| `sheet.prelude[].file` | `{{ workspace }}` | Jinja2 |
| `sheet.cadenzas[N][].file` | `{{ workspace }}` | Jinja2 |
| `cross_sheet.capture_files[]` | `{{ workspace }}` | Manual `{{ }}` replacement |
| `validations[].path` | `{workspace}` | Python `.format()` |
| `validations[].command` | `{workspace}` | Manual `{}` replacement (shell-quoted) |
| `validations[].working_directory` | `{workspace}` | Python `.format()` |
| `skip_when_command[N].command` | `{workspace}` | Manual `{}` replacement |

---

## Template Variables

### Core (always available in prompts)

| Variable | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `sheet_num` | int | Current sheet number (1-indexed) |
| `total_sheets` | int | Total sheets in job (after fan-out expansion) |
| `start_item` | int | First item number for this sheet |
| `end_item` | int | Last item number for this sheet |
| `workspace` | str | Absolute workspace path |
| `instrument_name` | str | Name of the instrument executing this sheet (e.g., `claude-code`) |

### Validation Variables

Available in validation `path`, `command`, and `working_directory` fields:

| Variable | Available |
|---|---|
| `{workspace}` | Always |
| `{sheet_num}` | Always |
| `{start_item}` | Always |
| `{end_item}` | Always |
| `{stage}` | When fan-out configured |
| `{instance}` | When fan-out configured |

**NOT available in validations**: `job_name`, `total_sheets`, user variables, `previous_outputs`. Use `command_succeeds` for complex validation logic that needs data not in the validation context.

---

## Validation Engineering

### How Validations Actually Work

Validations run **after each sheet execution**, not at the end of the job. Each sheet independently passes or fails. The engine:

1. **Before execution**: snapshots mtimes for all `file_modified` rules
2. **After execution**: runs validations by stage, with per-rule retries
3. **Staged fail-fast**: if any stage N rule fails, stages N+1+ are skipped
4. **Path security**: all paths must resolve inside the workspace (traversal blocked)
5. **Command timeout**: `command_succeeds` has a 3600-second (1 hour) default limit
6. **Command safety**: `{workspace}` values are shell-quoted via `shlex.quote()`

### The 5 Validation Types

| Type | Checks | Path Expansion | Good For |
|---|---|---|---|
| `file_exists` | File exists and is a file | `{workspace}`, `{sheet_num}` | Basic output verification |
| `file_modified` | mtime changed since sheet started | `{workspace}`, `{sheet_num}` | Proving agent changed a file |
| `content_contains` | Literal substring in file | `{workspace}`, `{sheet_num}` | Structural markers (headings, tags) |
| `content_regex` | Python regex match in file | `{workspace}`, `{sheet_num}` | Flexible pattern matching |
| `command_succeeds` | Shell command exits 0 | `{workspace}`, `{sheet_num}` | Tests, linting, builds, complex checks |

### Validation Fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | required | --- | One of the 5 types |
| `path` | str | None | File path with `{workspace}`, `{sheet_num}` expansion |
| `pattern` | str | None | Literal string or regex pattern |
| `command` | str | None | Shell command (for command_succeeds) |
| `working_directory` | str | None | CWD for command (default: workspace) |
| `description` | str | None | Human-readable name (shown in status and completion prompts) |
| `stage` | int (1-10) | 1 | Execution order; fail-fast between stages |
| `condition` | str | None | When this validation applies |
| `retry_count` | int (0-10) | 3 | Retries for race conditions |
| `retry_delay_ms` | int (0-5000) | 200 | Delay between retries |

### Writing Good Validations

**Principles:**

1. **Every sheet needs at least one validation.** No validations = sheet always "passes" = you learn nothing.
2. **Layer coarse to fine.** Stage 1: file exists. Stage 2: structure correct. Stage 3: tests pass.
3. **Match validations to prompt instructions.** If your prompt says "write to X," validate X exists. If it says "include a summary section," validate that section.
4. **Use `command_succeeds` for real verification.** File existence proves little. Run the tests. Check the build. Lint the code.
5. **Validate outcomes, not process.** For every goal in the prompt, ask: "Can the agent pass all my validations without achieving this goal?" If yes, your validations are decorative. See the "Process validations" anti-pattern below.

### Validation Anti-Patterns

**Too weak** --- file existence alone:
```yaml
# BAD: Only checks existence, not quality
- type: file_exists
  path: "{workspace}/analysis.md"

# BETTER: Layered verification
- type: file_exists
  path: "{workspace}/analysis.md"
  stage: 1
- type: content_contains
  path: "{workspace}/analysis.md"
  pattern: "## Findings"
  stage: 2
- type: command_succeeds
  command: 'test $(wc -w < "{workspace}/analysis.md") -ge 200'
  stage: 2
  description: "Analysis has substantive content"
```

**Too broad** --- regex matches anything:
```yaml
# BAD: Matches any file with text
- type: content_regex
  pattern: ".*"

# BETTER: Specific structural check
- type: content_regex
  pattern: "(?s)## Summary.*## Recommendations"
  description: "Has both Summary and Recommendations sections"
```

**Too strict** --- exact prose matching:
```yaml
# BAD: Breaks on minor rephrasing
- type: content_contains
  pattern: "The analysis shows that the total count is 42."

# BETTER: Structural markers, not exact prose
- type: content_regex
  pattern: "(?i)(analysis|summary).*\\btotal\\b.*\\d+"
```

**Non-coding tasks**: For writing, philosophy, creative work --- file existence + structural markers (headings, word count) are your best bet. You can't validate whether a philosophical argument is *good* via regex. Use `command_succeeds` with `wc -w` for minimum substance.

**Process validations instead of outcome validations** --- the most dangerous anti-pattern because the score *looks* like it's working:

Structural validations (file exists, tests pass, imports work, lint clean) measure whether the agent *did work*. They don't measure whether the agent *achieved the goal*. Agents optimize for what's measured. If every validation can pass without the core problem being fixed, the agent will fix peripheral issues, write tests against the current (broken) behavior, produce reports declaring victory, and never touch the actual problem. The score completes. Nothing changed.

**The litmus test:** For every goal in the prompt, ask: *"Can the agent pass all my validations without achieving this goal?"* If yes, add a validation that can't.

**Example 1 --- prompt says "add pagination to the list endpoint":**
```yaml
# BAD: Agent can refactor nearby code, make tests pass, and never add pagination
- type: command_succeeds
  command: 'pytest tests/test_api.py -x -q'
- type: file_modified
  path: "{workspace}/src/api/routes.py"

# GOOD: Hit the endpoint and verify pagination actually works
- type: command_succeeds
  command: |
    cd {workspace} && python -c "
    from app.routes import app
    from app.testing import client
    resp = client(app).get('/items?page=2&per_page=5')
    data = resp.json()
    assert 'page' in data and 'total_pages' in data, 'Response missing pagination fields'
    assert len(data['items']) <= 5, 'per_page limit not enforced'
    "
  description: "Pagination endpoint returns paginated response"
```

**Example 2 --- prompt says "replace raw SQL with the ORM":**
```yaml
# BAD: Agent can fix lint, add comments, write new tests --- raw SQL still there
- type: command_succeeds
  command: 'ruff check {workspace}/src/'
- type: command_succeeds
  command: 'pytest tests/ -x -q'

# GOOD: Directly asserts the goal --- no raw SQL remains
- type: command_succeeds
  command: '! grep -rn "execute(\"SELECT\|execute(\"INSERT\|execute(\"UPDATE" {workspace}/src/'
  description: "No raw SQL queries remain in source"
```

**Example 3 --- prompt says "write a design doc comparing approach A vs B":**
```yaml
# BAD: Agent writes anything to the file and it passes
- type: file_exists
  path: "{workspace}/design.md"
- type: content_contains
  path: "{workspace}/design.md"
  pattern: "IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE: yes"

# GOOD: Validates the deliverable has the structure the prompt asked for
- type: content_regex
  path: "{workspace}/design.md"
  pattern: "(?si)## .*approach a.*## .*approach b"
  description: "Doc has sections for both approaches"
- type: content_regex
  path: "{workspace}/design.md"
  pattern: "(?si)(pro|advantage|strength|upside|benefit).*\\n.*(con|disadvantage|weakness|downside|drawback)"
  description: "Doc contains pros/cons comparison"
- type: command_succeeds
  command: 'test $(wc -w < "{workspace}/design.md") -ge 800'
  description: "Doc has substantive content (800+ words)"
```

### Conditional Validations

```yaml
# Supported: >=, <=, ==, !=, >, <
# Combine with "and" (no "or" --- use separate rules)
validations:
  - type: file_exists
    path: "{workspace}/01-setup.md"
    condition: "sheet_num == 1"
  - type: file_exists
    path: "{workspace}/synthesis.md"
    condition: "stage >= 3"
  - type: command_succeeds
    command: 'pytest tests/'
    condition: "stage == 2 and instance == 1"
```

### Staged Validations (Build Pipeline)

```yaml
validations:
  # Stage 1: Fast checks
  - type: command_succeeds
    command: 'ruff check {workspace}/src/'
    stage: 1
    description: "Lint passes"
  # Stage 2: Tests (only if lint passes)
  - type: command_succeeds
    command: 'cd {workspace} && pytest -x'
    stage: 2
    description: "Tests pass"
```

## Config Structure Reference

### Required Fields

```yaml
name: "job-name"              # Unique identifier
workspace: "./my-workspace"   # Directory for artifacts (resolved to absolute)

sheet:
  size: 5                     # Items per sheet (>= 1)
  total_items: 25             # Total work items

prompt:
  template: |                 # Inline Jinja2 template
    Your prompt here for sheet {{ sheet_num }}.
```

### Instrument (Recommended)

```yaml
# Use a named instrument (run `mozart instruments list` to see available)
instrument: claude-code
instrument_config:
  timeout_seconds: 1800         # Per-sheet timeout (30 min default)
  skip_permissions: true        # REQUIRED for unattended execution
  disable_mcp: true             # ~2x speedup, prevents contention
  cli_model: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929  # Model override
  allowed_tools: [Read, Grep, Glob, Write, Edit]  # Tool restrictions
```

Built-in instruments: `claude-code`, `gemini-cli`, `codex-cli`, `cline-cli`, `aider`, `goose`. Plus any CLI tool via YAML profiles in `~/.mozart/instruments/`.

### Backend (Legacy Syntax)

The `backend:` syntax still works but `instrument:` is preferred for new scores.

```yaml
backend:
  type: claude_cli              # claude_cli | anthropic_api | ollama | recursive_light
  skip_permissions: true        # REQUIRED for unattended execution
  timeout_seconds: 1800         # Per-sheet timeout (30 min default)
  disable_mcp: true             # ~2x speedup, prevents contention
  output_format: json           # json | text | stream-json
  cli_model: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929  # Model override
  allowed_tools: [Read, Grep, Glob, Write, Edit]  # Tool restrictions
  system_prompt_file: ./system.md  # Custom system prompt
  cli_extra_args: ["--verbose"]    # Escape hatch
  max_output_capture_bytes: 51200  # stdout/stderr capture (50KB default)
  timeout_overrides:
    7: 28800                    # Per-sheet overrides (8 hours)
```

## Jinja in YAML --- Gotchas

### Always use `|` for templates

```yaml
# CORRECT --- literal block preserves newlines
prompt:
  template: |
    Line one.
    Line two.

# WRONG --- folded block collapses newlines
prompt:
  template: >
    Line one.
    Line two.
```

### Quote Jinja in YAML values

```yaml
# WRONG --- YAML parser chokes on bare {{
path: {{ workspace }}/file.md

# CORRECT --- quoted
path: "{{ workspace }}/file.md"
```

### Escape literal `{{ }}` in content

```yaml
prompt:
  template: |
    {% raw %}
    The format is: {{ variable_name }}
    {% endraw %}

    # Or: {{ '{{' }} variable_name {{ '}}' }}
```

### Double-escape regex in YAML

```yaml
# WRONG --- \d in YAML is just d
pattern: "\d+\.\s+"

# CORRECT --- double-escaped
pattern: "\\d+\\.\\s+"

# ALSO CORRECT --- single-quoted YAML (no escaping)
pattern: '\d+\.\s+'
```

### StrictUndefined catches typos

`UndefinedError` means a variable name is wrong. Common: `workshpace` (workspace), `sheetnum` (sheet_num), `totalSheets` (total_sheets).

## Common Pitfalls

| # | Pitfall | What Happens | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `{{ }}` in validation paths | `.format()` treats `{{` as literal `{` | Use `{workspace}` not `{{ workspace }}` |
| 2 | `{}` in prompt template | Jinja ignores single braces | Use `{{ workspace }}` in templates |
| 3 | No validations | Sheet always "passes" | Always add meaningful validations |
| 4 | `file_exists` only | File may exist from previous run | Combine with `file_modified` or content checks |
| 5 | Prescriptive prompts | Agent can't adapt; brittle | Specify outcomes, not commands |
| 6 | Missing `skip_permissions` | Claude prompts for permission, hangs | Always set `skip_permissions: true` |
| 7 | Missing `disable_mcp` | MCP spawns children, deadlocks | Set `disable_mcp: true` unless needed |
| 8 | `sheet_num` with fan-out | Changes after expansion | Use `stage` for conditionals |
| 9 | `fan_out` without `dependencies` | Stages run out of order | Always declare dependencies |
| 10 | `fan_out` without `parallel` | Sequential execution (slow) | Enable parallel for concurrency |
| 11 | Variable shadows core name | `variables.workspace` overrides real | Don't reuse: workspace, sheet_num, stage, etc. |
| 12 | `>` folded string for template | Newlines collapse | Always use `\|` literal block |
| 13 | `job_name` in template | Not a variable --- UndefinedError | Put in `prompt.variables` if needed |
| 14 | External `timeout` wrapper | SIGKILL corrupts state | Use `backend.timeout_seconds` |
| 15 | No `fresh: true` in self-chain | Loads COMPLETED state, zero work | Always `fresh: true` for self-chaining |
| 16 | Regex without double-escape | `\d` in YAML is just `d` | Use `\\d` or single-quoted strings |
| 17 | Config changes after first run | Resume auto-reloads from YAML | Use `--no-reload` for cached snapshot |
| 18 | Condition with `or` | Not supported --- evaluates wrong | Use separate validation rules |
| 19 | `capture_files` uses `{}` | Capture files ARE Jinja-processed | Use `{{ workspace }}` in capture_files |
| 20 | Relative paths (workspace, `job_path`) | Resolve from daemon CWD, not score file dir | Use absolute paths everywhere — workspace, `on_success.job_path`, prelude files |
| 21 | Summary-only synthesis | Produces summaries, not insights | Ask for convergences, tensions, emergence |
| 22 | `command_succeeds` default 3600s | Full test suite outgrows timeout | Set `timeout_seconds` per-rule; see "Validation Timeouts" section |
| 23 | Integer keys in variable dicts | JSON roundtrip converts `{1: ...}` to `{"1": ...}`; Jinja2 `dict[instance]` fails because `instance` is int but key is string | Fixed in engine (auto-normalizes keys). Still prefer string keys for clarity, or use `dict[instance\|string]` as defense-in-depth |
| 24 | Stale detection kills verification stages | Agent runs pytest/mypy/ruff as child processes; no stdout → killed at idle_timeout | Use `idle_timeout_seconds: 1800`+, or fan-out verification into parallel instances |
| 25 | Process-only validations | Validations check file exists + tests pass + imports work, but never verify stated goals. Agent passes everything without fixing the actual problem. | For every goal in the prompt, ask: "Can the agent pass all validations without achieving this?" If yes, add one that can't. |
| 26 | Workspace = project root | `workspace_lifecycle.archive_on_fresh` archives or wipes the workspace directory. If workspace = project root, the entire project is destroyed. | NEVER set workspace to the project root. Use `./workspaces/{name}-workspace` or a dedicated absolute path. Check for `.git/`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml` at workspace path. |
| 27 | `--fresh` when `resume` was intended | `--fresh` wipes ALL completed work and starts over. If you cancelled a job to fix config, using `--fresh` destroys all progress. | Use `mozart resume <job> --reload-config -c fixed.yaml` to continue from where you stopped. Only use `--fresh` for intentionally new runs. |

## Pre-Flight Checklist

```bash
# 1. Validate config structure
mozart validate my-score.yaml

# 2. Simulate execution (shows sheet division, rendered prompts)
mozart run my-score.yaml --dry-run

# 3. Verify:
#    - Every sheet has at least one applicable validation?
#    - Validation paths use {workspace} not {{ workspace }}?
#    - Prompt template uses {{ workspace }} not {workspace}?
#    - backend.skip_permissions is true?
#    - Dependencies declared for parallel/fan-out?
#    - Timeouts appropriate for task complexity?
#    - Stale detection timeout >= 1800s for verification/build stages?
#    - Absolute workspace path?
```

### `mozart validate` Codes

| Code | Severity | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| V001 | ERROR | Jinja syntax error in template |
| V002 | ERROR | Workspace parent missing (auto-fixable) |
| V003 | ERROR | Template file not found |
| V007 | ERROR | Invalid regex in validation pattern |
| V101 | WARNING | Undefined template variables (false positives for `{% set %}`) |
| V103 | WARNING | Very short timeout |
| V108 | WARNING | Missing prelude/cadenza files (skips templated paths) |

---

## Mental Model: Execution Flow

1. **Config loaded** --- YAML parsed into Pydantic models; fan-out expanded
2. **State loaded** --- resume from checkpoint or start fresh
3. **For each sheet** (sequential or parallel via DAG):
   a. **Skip check** --- evaluate skip_when / skip_when_command
   b. **Context built** --- SheetContext with variables + cross-sheet data
   c. **Injections resolved** --- prelude/cadenza files read
   d. **Prompt rendered** --- Jinja2 processes template
   e. **Backend executes** --- Claude CLI spawned with rendered prompt
   f. **Output captured** --- stdout/stderr (truncated to ~10KB)
   g. **Validations run** --- staged, conditional, with retries
   h. **On failure** --- completion mode (>50% pass) or full retry with backoff
   i. **State saved** --- checkpoint after every state change
4. **On all sheets complete** --- run `on_success` hooks
